			-== Instructions for usage of the Interagtor utility ==-

+	About
	
	Integrator is a tool to be used by crackers for the purpose of 'static' DLL-injection 
	of DLLs into the target game's process.
	What the Integrator does is prepend code to the target game that loads up the given DLL from disk.
	
+	Usage
	
	The integrator is a command-line utility and therefore accepts command-line arguments.
	the argument format is as follows:
	
	Integrator.exe <Game_name>.exe <DLL_name>.dll
	
	where <Game_name> is the name of the game to which integration will be applied.
	where <DLL_name> is the name of the DLL to be loaded by the target game.
	
+	Notes for releasing of integrated games
	
	The tool outputs several files:
	-	<Game_name>.exe
	-	<Game_name>.bak
	-	<DLL_name>.dll
	
	The BAK file is only for backup purposes, it is a copy of the original <Game_name>.exe
	before integration.
